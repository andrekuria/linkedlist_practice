# linkedlist_practice
This is practice on implementation of linked lists in C .It is in relation to the course I am doing , Embedded Software and Hardware Architecture offered by the University of Colorado Boulder at Coursera. 



Linked_list.c - shows an abitrary way of implementing linked lists , where we are declaring a bunch of nodes before using them. 

Linked_list2.c - introducing a function thst creates a node for us instead of us crearing the nodes expicitly. 

Linked_list3.c - creating a linked list via loop 

Linked_list4.c - Implementing various functions that access the linked list.
